# Interesting seeds

> Note that first seeds were tested with old settings so they might not behave as described

- `helide_burdener`: complex cells.
- `polyp_naif`: moving cells chasing each other.
- `friborg_apositia`: wtf.
- `cessavit_pinkeys`: several different types of cells, all interesting.
- `amuletic_nutlike`: blue cells need some yellow particles to be stable.
- `hamlets_lingers`: big red cell with interesting shape. It can not merge (unstable) with the other one when there is two of them remaining.
- `vaginae_invecked`: red circle attacks blue particles. orange+yellow chases red. orange+purple makes stable cell.
- `nominy_tamboo`: light blue, purple and pink form cells with an interesting organisation.
- `adored_duvetine`: different structures, very lively.
- `hepcat_radius`
- `lifeway_unambush`
- `bestreak_incised`
- `gau_reformat`
- `coombes_embody`
